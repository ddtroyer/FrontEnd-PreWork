<h1 class="thingstocenter">About Me</h2>
<p id="intro">My career path has covered a lot of different areas, which at first don't seem to be
  connected. But each has contributed something towards how I became a developer.</p>
<p id="cr">I spent several years working for <a href="http://www.thecommercialrecord.com/">The Commercial Record</a>, a weekly newspaper in
  Saugatuck, Michigan. I started out as a typist and eventually
  became a copy editor and journalist. I also assisted with laying out the articles
  and advertisements. I have a good understanding of layouts, fonts, kerning, and how
  to manipulate objects so they'll fit in whatever space is available.  </p>
<p id="palisades">My next position was as a contractor at <a href="http://www.palisadespower.com/">Palisades
  Nuclear Plant</a> near Covert, Michigan. I worked in several different departments,
  mostly in document control. I learned a lot about databases as well as the importance of
  documentation and attention to detail. </p>
<p id="xilinx"> I spent two years in California working at <a href="http://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> in the legal department.
  In addition to document control, I also learned about the different parts of a legal
  contract and eventually was able to negotiate non-disclosure agreements. This position
  reinforced skills learned previously but also showed me that I was capable of learning anything. </p>
  <blockquote>My time in California was an adventure but I missed seeing the seasons change, thunderstorms,
    the lakes, and, most of all, my friends and family. </blockquote>
<p id="gc">In the background this whole time has been an interest in computers, not just as a user
  but as someone who is fascinated by how they work and what can be accomplished
  with them. After several years of sporadically taking online tutorials,
  I jumped into the programming world by enrolling in <a href="https://www.grandcircus.co/">Grand Circus'</a> inaugurial C#/.NET
  bootcamp in Grand Rapids. Having completed that program, I wanted more. I applied to
  Grand Circus' Front-End bootcamp in order to become a full-stack developer.</p>
